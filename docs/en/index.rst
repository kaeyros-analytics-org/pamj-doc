Overview
==========
**PAMJ-CMS** is a support platform for the conference organization process. The PAMJ-CMS platform enables you to structure the conference organizing team, register the various members and validate the conference information submitted by the speakers.

So, once on the platform, the user's action depends on what he wants to do in a conference. Whether he wants to manage or participate in a conference that already exists.
